1) An advantage of a linked list is that items can be added dynamically without instanciting a large amout of memory in one chunk. A disadvatage of a linked list is that the search time is O(n) and cannot be indexed like an array can. <br />
2) An advantage of using an array is that they can be indexed with O(1) (constant time complexity). A disadvantage of using an array is that the size of the array is pre-determined. When an item is added that makes the new size of the array larger than the pre-determined size, you must redefine the initial size of it.
